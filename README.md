# Privacy Tuna
*Privacy Tuna* is an open source visualization system for easily tuning the tradeoff between utility and privacy in trajectory data.
It is developed by the Database Group of the University of Leipzig, Germany.

It enables trajectory data owners to:

- Understand and estimate the risks from potential privacy leakage obtained from the location information of their data
- Select a suitable privacy-algorithm that prevents such information leakage
- Measure the utility of their data to understand its value
- Tune the parameters of a privacy mechanism so that a good balance between utility and privacy is achieved
